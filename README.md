# mc_rtc web-based UI

This is a prototype for a web-based ControllerClient for mc_rtc.

For now this is a stand-alone application but it could/should be implemented as a plugin for mc_rtc.

## Building

- Build the application here as usual and run it
- Open your browser at http://localhost:8080


## Building the Javascript component

Make sure node is installed on your machine.

- Go into the `mc-rtc-ts` folder
- `npm install` (once)
- `npm run build` (anytime you changes the Typescript sources)
